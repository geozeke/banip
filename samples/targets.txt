# Use two-letter country codes, one per line. Either uppercase or
# lowercase is fine. Blank lines, spaces, and lines starting with '#'
# are ignored. NOTE: These are the ISO-3166 ALPHA2 codes, not the
# two-letter Top Level Domain names (which may be different). For
# example, the two-letter TLD for the United Kingdom is "uk", but the
# ISO-3166 code for the United Kingdom is "gb". You can find a list of
# all the codes here: https://www.geonames.org/countries/
